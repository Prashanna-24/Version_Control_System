# Version_Control_System
A data security oriented approach

Implement a VCS-like structure that would enable us to securely monitor/share/build a filesystem with provisions to restrict data tampering and inconsistency.​
Taking inspiration from GIT, a similar structure has been build using Merkle trees.​
This would allow us to monitor unsanctioned changes in the files and securely monitor and share filesystems across users.​
